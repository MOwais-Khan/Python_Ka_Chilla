There is a definitive order to the categories (i.e., graduate is higher than undergraduate, and undergraduate is higher than high school), but we cannot make any other arithmetic assumptions beyond that.  For instance, we cannot assume that the difference in education level between undergraduate and high school is the same as the difference between graduate and undergraduate.\n",
